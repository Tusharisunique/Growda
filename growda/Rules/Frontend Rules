# Frontend Rules
- Must use React + Vite + Tailwind + axios.
- All API calls must go through src/services/api.js.
- Never hardcode backend URL; use import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL.
- Diagnosis page = upload → preview → POST /predict → show results.
- Dashboard polls /status every 3s.
- Use clean hospital UI theme (white, blue, gray).
- Always validate file before uploading.
- Add loading states + error toasts.
