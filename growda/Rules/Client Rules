# Client Rules
- Both clients must be identical except dataset path.
- class_mode = 'binary'.
- Use flow_from_directory() with (150,150) size.
- fit() must always return (weights, num_examples, metrics).
- evaluate() must handle empty validation folders gracefully.
- No encryption needed for prototype; pass-through only.
- Use start_numpy_client() only.
