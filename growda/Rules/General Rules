# GROWDA — Global Rules
- Keep project structure exactly intact (backend/, clients/, frontend/).
- Never change file paths unless explicitly told.
- Model = Binary classifier. Output shape = 1 neuron (sigmoid).
- All clients MUST use identical model.py.
- All clients MUST return (parameters_updated, num_examples, results_dict).
- Never modify dataset paths without confirming.
- Keep API endpoints exactly: /predict, /status, /train_round.
- Ensure all backend responses are JSON, no HTML.
- Always maintain compatibility with Python 3.9 and TF2.x.
- Federated server must never crash; add defensive checks.
- Frontend must use VITE_API_BASE_URL for all API calls.
- Always keep code minimal, clean, and readable.
