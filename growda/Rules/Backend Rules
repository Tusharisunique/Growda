# Backend Rules
- Use FastAPI with CORS enabled for frontend.
- Flower server must run non-blocking (thread or subprocess).
- Save global model as 'global_model.keras' only.
- /train_round must respond immediately, not block training.
- /predict must load global_model.keras if exists.
- /status must return round, accuracy, connected_clients.
- Ensure backend never depends on frontend state.
- Do NOT use deprecated Flower functionalities.
- Avoid large weight logs; keep output minimal.
